        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p>These vegan brownies are made with cocoa powder for a rich and gooey chocolaty treat.</p>
        <p>If you prefer brownies that are a little more solid, you can bake the brownies for longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies, too!</p>
       
        <h3 class="heading">Ingredients</h3>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this homemade vegan brownie recipe:</p>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This vegan brownie starts with all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>Make sure the package is labeled "vegan", as some store-bought white sugars aren't strictly vegan</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa Powder:</strong>You'll need Â¾ cups of good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li><strong>Baking Powder:</strong>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the vegan brownies rise</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong>Salt enhances the overall flavor of the brownies, but it won't make them taste salty</li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong> or <strong>Coffee:</strong>Use a cup of hot water (or a cup of brewed coffee for more flavor)</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong>Vegetable oil keeps these vegan brownies nice and moist</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch</li>
        </ul>
